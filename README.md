# JRPG-Game
A JRPG built in XNA, as more of a proof of concept and learning experience

This was built in the summer of 2016, but was abandoned due to life getting busy. Built in C#, and more technically correct is Monogame
which is built on XNA. JPRG stands for Japanese Role Playing Game, and plays similar to earlier final fantasy, chrono trigger,
and many others like it. The code itself is very large-scale, meaning that there is a lot of room for things to be plugged in and expanded upon,
but seems like overkill in its current state.


# Ok, but what's actually in it?

Well there's a wiki that explains everything in great detail, but for brevity: it's a pet project for what was essentially a self
challenge to do as much OOP as possible, which in hindsight I'm unsure was the best choice. Regardless, its current state is
very open to adding more, but you wouldn't actually want to play the game. This was almost the intention with this project. 
If I wanted to make an RPG, I'd use RPG Maker. But since I wanna learn *how* to make an RPG, things like story are low priority.
Of course I'd like to implement the tools for it, but once it works in proof of concept, no further extension is required.

# What can I do to help?

Well if you want you could just download and it mess around with it yourself, but I'd probably advise against that for the time being,
as its a bit of a mess (think of a delicate ecosystem).
